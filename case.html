				<h3 class="case-sub-head">Objective</h3>
				<p>
					This was a group-project, in which my team had to evaluate a Northern Ontario hospital
					website (<a href="http://www.geraldtondh.com/">Geraldton District Hospital</a>), 
					and come up with proposal to improve the website design. The objective of the 
					hospital website evaluation was to,
					<ul>
						<li>make the website more navigable and hence improve accessibility,</li>
						<li>add new features which are currently not there on the website,</li>
						<li>develop a content management system (CMS) so that the admin of the hospital can 
						maintain the content of the website conveniently,</li>
						<li>design the dataflow model of the CRUD (create, read, update ad delete) 
						functionalities of the newly proposed features, which list the sequence of steps 
						as the user complete any of the CRUD functionality,</li>
						<li>design the wireframes of the features.</li>
					</ul>
					
					Aspects such as the design of the navigational menu and addition of a new features was 
					a group activity, working on the design of a feature was an individual activity. I 
					worked on the design of the hospital "doctor's feature". 
					
					This has to be done while keeping in consideration personas of visitors visiting the website. 
					By adding new features such as list of doctors at the hospital, and news blog would increase 
					the engagement of community with the hospital. They can use the list of doctors page to 
					showcase the skillsets of physicians serving at their hospital, which can provide good 
					marketing for the hospital.

				<h3 class="case-sub-head">Database Table Design:</h3>
				
				<p>
					The database table of the doctor is illustrated in the image below.
				</p>
				
				<div class="text-center">
					<figure>
						<img src="images/doctor-table.jpg" alt="Doctor database table entries" class="img-thumbnail">
						<figcaption>Database table with list of fields and data type.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					Only the "Personal" field is nullable, apart from this all the other fields must be input. User 
					is informed about the nullable field with the "(Optional)" tag next to the field name on the form.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					DoctorID is the primary key (PK) which uniquely identifies a doctor in the database. This primary 
					key can also be used to link it to the doctor’s appointment feature. The photo stores the photo 
					(passport sized professional headshot) which would be displayed on the doctor’s profile. The FullName
					field would display the full name of the doctor (first, middle and last name). The CPSOReg is the 
					CPSO professional registration of the doctor. The Email field would include the official email address
					of the doctor. The Education field will list the post-secondary educational qualification of the doctor
					along with the university attended by the doctor. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The photo field will store one photo of the doctor. Saving multiple photos would require establishing 
					a one-to-many relationship, which would make the database design relatively complex. The Expertise field 
					would list the medical expertise which the doctor has e.g. weight loss, rehabilitation counselling. 
					The Biography and Personal field would store a short professional biographical account of the doctor, 
					and the personal field would store information about the personal interest of the doctor.
				</p>

				<h3 class="case-sub-head">Thought-process:</h3>
			
				<p>
					First an evaluation of the current features of the hospital website was performed. 
					During this activity the importance for each of the page was evaluated based on how frequently 
					the page is updated, and then based on the relevancy for each of the page, a proposal was
					made whether to keep or discard the page.
				</p>

				<p>
					Card-sorting activity was then conducted with the help of volunteers to improve the navigation
					menu design. For the newly proposed features, or those which required a re-design, a list of 
					error messages when submitting the form was written along with constructive feedback for the 
					user to correct the message was written down. A form validation error message would be shown 
					to the user whenever the form input does not match the range of valid input values for the field.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once the form error messages were written down, a dataflow model for the sequence of steps 
					which the user would perform to successfully complete the CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
					features was the designed. This sequence of steps then served as the foundation for the 
					final wireframes. The dataflow provided direction for the back-end developer to take, 
					such as update the database table when the user adds a new doctor. The wireframe can be used
					by a front-end developer to develop the design of the webpage.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Flowcharts and wireframes for the different operations of the doctor's features are discussed 
					in the next subsections.

				<h4 class="case-sub-head">List of doctor and visitor view of doctor page</h4>
				<p>
					The list of doctor is the default view which the admin sees when updating
					the doctor's information. Wireframe of the list of doctor page which the 
					admin user can see, and the information about a doctor which a visitor to 
					the hospital website can see are shown below.
