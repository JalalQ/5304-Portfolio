# Introduction
Design of my portfolio website which I completed as part of the 'Portfolio Development' course when I was enrolled as the student of the Grad Cert in Web Dev program at Humber College (2020-21). The porfolio webpage was designed to be response using Bootstrap. Some of the `live links` in the `index.html` page has been removed, to avoid uploading redundant code. The projects these `live links` refer to can be found from the corresponding active github repo links.
